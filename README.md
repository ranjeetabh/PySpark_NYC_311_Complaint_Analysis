# NYC_311_Complaint_Analysis

This PySpark application programmatically aimed to do the following:

1)	Analyze NYC 311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present.

2)	Apply machine learning and build a predictive model to try and predict the amount of time that it will take for an issue to go from “Open” to “Closed” among “Closed” tickets.

3)	Determine which features are useful for prediction.

This repository contains the following files:

1) 311_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb: Detailed PySpark notebook containing analysis of 311 service complaints. 

2) 311_Analysis_Document: Explanation of results obtained and procedures undertaken.
